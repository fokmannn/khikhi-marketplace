# Permit Web3 Marketplace

### About The Build

Permit Marketplace is a Web3 marketplace of the Metaverse which is powered by ThirdWeb. You can purchase and sell your own NFTs and the cool part is - you can create an auction of your NFTs. It even has Live Search Functionality in the Home Screen.


## Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Next.js is a React Production Framework which gives the best developer experience with all the features for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## How To Start

### Start with a pre-made Starter Template

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example with a pre-configured starter template of NextJs App with TailwindCSS:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
```

### Now finally run your Project

Run your build process with `npm run dev` or whatever command is configured in your `package.json` file.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

Open or create a `.env` file then edit add this setting

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT=key_goes_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_CONTRACT=key_goes_here
```
Web 3, with its decentralized nature and use of blockchain technology, has the potential to revolutionize the way countries handle work permits and residence permits. Here's a comprehensive analysis of how Web 3 can be the future in this domain, emphasizing its security features and providing examples to illustrate its potential impact:

1. Enhanced Security:
   Web 3 leverages blockchain technology, which offers inherent security features such as immutability, transparency, and decentralized consensus. These features can greatly enhance the security of work permits and residence permits, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft. By storing permit-related information on a blockchain, it becomes tamper-proof and resistant to unauthorized modifications, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the permits.

   Example: Instead of relying on physical documents that can be easily forged or manipulated, Web 3 allows countries to issue digital permits as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on a blockchain. These NFTs can store unique identifiers, biometric data, and other relevant information, making them highly secure and difficult to counterfeit.

2. Decentralized Verification:
   With Web 3, the verification process for work permits and residence permits can be decentralized, eliminating the need for centralized authorities and streamlining the validation process. Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the verification process, ensuring that all necessary criteria are met before granting or renewing a permit. This reduces administrative burden and eliminates the potential for human error or corruption.

   Example: A decentralized permit marketplace built on Web 3 can enable employers and immigration authorities to interact directly. When an individual applies for a work permit, the necessary information can be stored on the blockchain, and smart contracts can validate the applicant's qualifications and eligibility. This automated process saves time and ensures fairness and transparency.

3. Improved Accessibility and Efficiency:
   Web 3 technologies can make the application and management of work permits and residence permits more accessible and efficient. By leveraging decentralized networks, individuals can securely access and manage their permits from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical visits to government offices or embassies. This simplifies the process and reduces bureaucratic barriers.

   Example: Through a Web 3 permit marketplace, applicants can create auctions for their permits, allowing potential employers or sponsors to bid for the permits based on their specific needs. This decentralized marketplace fosters competition and ensures that permits are allocated to the most suitable candidates efficiently.

4. Interoperability and Standardization:
   Web 3 promotes interoperability and standardization of data formats, allowing different countries and organizations to seamlessly share and verify permit-related information. This can facilitate international collaborations and simplify the process for individuals seeking employment or residency across borders.

   Example: Through the use of standardized data formats and interoperable protocols, countries can establish a global network for work permits and residence permits. This network can enable efficient information sharing and verification, making it easier for individuals to transition between countries and reducing the administrative burden for governments.

In conclusion, Web 3's decentralized nature, enhanced security, decentralized verification, improved accessibility, and interoperability make it a promising framework for transforming the issuance and management of work permits and residence permits. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, countries can create a more secure, efficient, and transparent system, benefiting both individuals and governments.

#Inspiration
The inspiration behind the creation of the Permit Web3 Marketplace for the Work and Residence Permits Hackathon was to leverage the potential of Web3 technologies, particularly blockchain and NFTs, to revolutionize the process of obtaining and managing work permits and residence permits.

The application, built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, provides a user-friendly and efficient platform where individuals can purchase, sell, and auction their own NFTs related to work permits and residence permits. The use of NFTs brings unique benefits, such as immutability and traceability, to the permit marketplace.

By utilizing Web3 technologies, the application taps into the concept of the Metaverse, creating a decentralized marketplace that transcends traditional boundaries and enables individuals from various countries to interact and transact securely. The application harnesses the power of ThirdWeb, a platform that likely provides infrastructure and tools for Web3 development.

JavaScript was chosen as the language for the application, which is a popular choice for web development due to its versatility and extensive ecosystem. Next.js, a React production framework, was utilized to provide a robust development environment with features such as hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, and route pre-fetching.

The application's architecture allows developers to start quickly by utilizing a pre-made Starter Template provided by Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This template includes a well-configured setup that eliminates the need for extensive manual configuration, allowing developers to focus on building the application's features.

The application also utilizes environment variables to securely store sensitive information, such as marketplace and collection contract keys. This practice ensures that sensitive data remains protected and separate from the application's codebase.

Overall, the Permit Web3 Marketplace is a forward-thinking application that harnesses the potential of Web3 technologies to redefine the way work permits and residence permits are obtained, managed, and traded. By leveraging blockchain, NFTs, and a user-friendly interface, the application aims to create a more secure, transparent, and efficient system for individuals and authorities involved in the permit process.
